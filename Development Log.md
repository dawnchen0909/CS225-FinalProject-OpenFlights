# Development Log (Date: 30/10/2022 -- 4/11/2022)

## Weekly Goals
1. Finish the team contract, project proposal, and github link that is due on 5/11/2022.

2. Understand each project dataset and project goals.

3. Try to divide the project into smaller parts and assign them to each week.

## Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)
1. Team Contract (completed by all group members)

2. Project Proposal (completed by all group members)

3. Github Link Creation (completed by all group members)
## Problems Encountered 

Difficulties in trying to understand the datasets and algorithms.

Donâ€™t know how to divide a huge task into smaller problems.

## Plans for next week
We plan to establish our basic data set like data selection and implement it into our coding work. Moreover, we plan to complete the BFS traversal to make sure the rest functions would debug depending on our traversal.

## Optional: Questions for mentor
None.

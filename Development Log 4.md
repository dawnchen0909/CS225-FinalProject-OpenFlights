# Development Log (Date: 11/26/2022 -- 12/2/2022)

## Weekly Goals

Complete the writing of at least two algorithms. These algorithms are BFS and Dijkstra's algorithm, while learning the Page Rank algorithm.

## Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)

##### Dawn Chen:

Learning Page Rank algorithm

Refilter the airport, airline, and route data by deleting missing data

##### Shuzhen Zhang:

Finished the Dijkstraâ€™s algorism.

Finished basic graph construct. 

##### Tongrui Yu:

Finished writing the BFS. This includes the traversal between two airports. The output will be all airports between two airports.

Resolved some previous bugs.


## Problems Encountered 

##### Dawn Chen:

Implement Page Rank algorithm on our current dataset and graph structure

##### Shuzhen Zhang:

Data confliction  

##### Tongrui Yu:

There is a problem with data filtering.

## Plans for next week

##### Dawn Chen:

Finish Page Rank algorithm
	Writing tests corresponding to Page Rank algorithm

##### Shuzhen Zhang:

Overall debugging and testing  

##### Tongrui Yu:

Upgate the BFS to make it a full traversal.

## Optional: Questions for mentor

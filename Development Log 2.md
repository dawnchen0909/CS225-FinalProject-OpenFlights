# Development Log (Date: 11/05/2022 -- 11/11/2022)

## Weekly Goals

Acquire and process each of the three data into the code. Write the underlying data structure to support subsequent work.

## Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)
###### Shuzhen Zhang:
    
    
    · MakeFile adapting

    · Established basic structure for data storage
    
    · Construct splitter
    
    · Writing code to access airports data and store in the code

###### Tongrui Yu:
    
    · Optimizatied detail structure on the base of Shuzhen’s work.

    · Fixed the Makefile base on the Shuzhen’s work.

    · Writing the code that to access airlines data and store in the code.

###### Dawn Chen:
    
    · Data acquisition and processing for routes.dat
    
    · Elaborate file structure

## Problems Encountered 

    · Multiple splitter should be consider 
    
    · Different character need to be consider like numeric character and Arabic Language 
    
    · Problems on writing Makefile (link error)

## Plans for next week
    
    · More detailed calculations on the route.
    
    · Link the three data together.

## Optional: Questions for mentor
    
    · Head file can not be read directly by cpp directly, and need to add pretext.
